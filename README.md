# hello-world
my first repository!
My name is Danyal. I am a recent grad who is currently learning the foundations of front-end coding (Right now I finished the basics of HTMl and CSS from FreeCodeCamp, moving onto JavaScript).I hope to teach myself code so I can become proficient enough to get a job and give back to the community.
